% I would like to express interest in your recruitment of an organizer.
% As a current Senior -- graduating in May --
% in Anthropology at
% the University of Illinois with strong research and data manipulation
% skills, I am certain I can be a welcome candidate for this position.

% Studying the field of Anthropology has given me research skills that
% are particularly attuned to the requirements of SEIU's needs.
% The discipline is heavily focused on understanding peoples of disparate
% backgrounds and cultures, which influences not only my work but my worldview and
% ideology. As a student of Anthropology, I have spent extended time in different
% cultures in addition to my studies. My studies also include great
% experience in both qualitative and quantitative data interpretation: in 2017
% I conducted an independent research project collecting data on wild
% capuchin monkeys for several weeks, performing statistical hypothesis
% tests on the data I collected; in 2018, I spent a semester in Kenya, where
% I surveyed a population of persons with disabilities and collected qualitative
% data on their life experiences. My most recent project involved a comprehensive
% and quantitative literature review on published ecological data.

% As a function of this research experience, I have displayed exceptional
% communication and writing skills. For all of my undergraduate research projects,
% I developed presentations, including posters and slideshows, focused both for
% colleagues and laypersons. In my past employment, I have displayed significant
% diligence and attention to detail in applying this communication skill. At
% Gold Rush Gaming in the past summer, I created reports for the marketing department
% and designed document templates for regular use in public relations and
% in internal communication. At the University Library, I helped scholars
% find academic sources for their research in one of the country's largest
% library systems.

% My qualification for this position extends beyond my particular skill set -- I
% also have an passionate interest in working for SEIU. I want to assist
% the labor movement in improving working people's wages and work environments.
% With my intercultural skill and academic experience, the best way in which
% I can assist SEIU's work is as a diligent researcher.

I hope you are able to find that my skills and drive are well-attuned to this position.
